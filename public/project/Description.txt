Fake GM is going to be a web application that allows users to build sports teams from scratch. Utilizing the Sportradar API, the web application will allow users to search players of different sports, and add/remove them to their team. Users will also be allowed to update their teams by having the ability to make trades with other users. The web application will allow users to compare sports data of different professional athletes when deciding on whether or not to add them to their team. There are currently fantasy sports applications on the web, but this is different. It will be more open ended, with the goal to allow people to try their hand at what it’s like to be a professional sports general manager (a job that is in charge of building and maintaining a sports team). Users will be able to view their team in a list format, as well as all of the available players in a list format with the immediate option to be able to add an available player to their team. Users will be able to customize their team info, including their name, logo, and description. This web application won’t have an expiration, like current fantasy sports ones, where when the season is over, the fantasy sports are over too. This will be different because it will allow users to maintain their teams forever, and constantly provide up to date reliable data on the professional athletes. The API is currently used by the NBA, NFL, NHL and NASCAR, and supports over 40 professional sports. By integrating this API, users will have everything that they need at their fingertips to make the best possible decisions towards their customized teams.
